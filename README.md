NASA Mission Control API

This is a personal project that follows @ZTM node course.

I'll explore API server architecture, best practices and rest conventions.

The base tech stack is node + express.

## Configuration

The server will run by default on port `8000`, but you can specify a different one by passing the PORT env variable i.e.: `PORT=5000`

By default the API will allow cross origin request from `http://localhost:3000`
